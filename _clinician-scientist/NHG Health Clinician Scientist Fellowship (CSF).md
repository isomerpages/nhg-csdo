<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>NHG Health Clinician Scientist Fellowship (CSF)</strong> aims
to nurture and develop clinician scientists by supporting them with a <u>formal research training programme leading to PhD</u>.
The CSF provides top-up funding to successful National Medical Research
Council (NMRC) Research Training Fellowship (RTF) awards to ensure clinicians
are adequately supported for the PhD.</p>
<h4><strong>Funding Support</strong></h4>
<p>Applicants are required to maximise the budget in their NMRC RTF applications
to include necessary support such as tuition fees, salary support for research
FTE committed to PhD, overseas conference, etc. The CSF provides <strong>top-up </strong>for
the following fundable items after accounting for the support received
under the NMRC RTF award.</p>
<p>a) Tuition fees, for up to 4 years</p>
<p>b) Salary support for research FTE, for up to 3 years</p>
<p>• Clinical FTE will continue to be provided by NHG Health Host Institution.</p>
<p>• Annual salary cap by awardee’s clinical designation will apply for NHG
Health Group Office’s contribution (Table 1). NHG Health Host Institution
will need to top-up the difference if the salary cap is exceeded.</p>
<p>• Salary support will cover the total annual compensation, inclusive of
salaries, CPF, fringe benefits, as well as bonus / incentive payments.</p>
