<p>Clinician-Scientists juggle between the functions of both a Clinician
and a Scientist.</p>
<p>NHG Clinician-Scientists share their journey and the dual role they take
on in treating patients and in advancing research; as well as showcasing
the joint efforts between NHG and LKCMedicine in grooming our Clinician
Scientists.</p>
