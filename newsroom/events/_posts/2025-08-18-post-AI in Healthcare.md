<p>The AI in Healthcare workshop, co-organised by ACSI and C-AIM on 18 August
2025 was attended by clinicians, faculty, researchers and innovators from
the cluster.</p>
<p>Prof Joseph Sung, Dean of LKCMedicine, set an energising tone with his
opening address, paving the way for invited speakers to share groundbreaking
insights into AI research and implementation. The presentations captivated
attendees as they explored emerging applications in patient diagnosis and
delved into the critical importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare
settings.</p>
<p>The next segment of the workshop presented attendees with the opportunity
to exchange and present their views on AI.&nbsp; Attendees managed to engage
in insightful discussions as they got to share about the usage of AI in
their respective institutions.</p>
<p>The vibrant exchanges revealed a unified vision that AI should serve as
a partner that enhances clinical decision-making rather than replacing
the irreplaceable human expertise of healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Through the workshop, we hope more collaborations and partnerships were
fostered within the cluster to transform healthcare delivery!</p>
