<p>On 15 August 2024, ACSI hosted its second Research Symposium, this time
with the theme of Stratified Medicine. The event aimed to foster scientific
exchange, promote interdisciplinary collaborations, and build robust research
networks. <strong>Prof Lim Tock Han</strong> and <strong>Prof John Chambers</strong> opened
the symposium, with Prof Lim sharing insightful remarks on the ongoing
shift in healthcare towards Population Health and prevention.</p>
<p>The symposium featured five distinguished speakers who shared their cutting-edge
research in stratified medicine and its clinical applications. <strong>A/Prof Rinkoo Dalan </strong>(TTSH/LKCMedicine)
discussed her ‘Personalised Cardiometabolic Risk Management Program.’ <strong>Asst Prof Lee Eng Sing </strong>(NHGP/LKCMedicine)
presented on the ‘Primary Care Research Network.’ <strong>Asst Prof Shen Xiaotao</strong> (LKCMedicine)
delved into molecular phenotypes and responses during pregnancy. <strong>Asst Prof Yeo See Cheng </strong>(TTSH)
focused on stratified medicine in kidney health. Lastly, <strong>Asst Prof Yew Yik Weng</strong> (NSC/LKCMedicine)
shared on examining the Asian phenotype of Atopic Dermatitis through a
stratified medicine approach. The audience was highly engaged, making the
symposium lively and interactive.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing this momentum at our next Research Symposium
in November, which will focus on Research Enablers. Stay tuned!</p>
