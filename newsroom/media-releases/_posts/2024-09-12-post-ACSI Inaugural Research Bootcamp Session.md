<p>In the afternoon of 12 September 2024, mentees and mentors alike gathered
for our first session of the <strong>inaugural ACSI Research Bootcamp</strong>.
The Bootcamp is part of ACSI’s efforts to support budding clinician scientists
and innovators, by providing a valuable opportunity for aspiring junior
CSs/CIs to receive targeted and individualised feedback for their research
ideas and grant proposals.</p>
<p>This session was led by ACSI Co-Leads <strong>A/Prof Rupesh Agrawal</strong> and <strong>Asst Prof Marie Loh</strong>,
and attended by ACSI Mentors such as <strong>Prof David Lye</strong>, <strong>A/Prof Lim Su Chi</strong>, <strong>A/Prof Sunny Wong</strong>,
and <strong>Dr Shum Cheuk Fan</strong>.</p>
<p>As part of the Bootcamp, each of the four mentees presented in turn an
overview of their research ideas for their upcoming grant applications.
After each sharing, our ACSI Mentors gave their feedback, comments, and
insights – on aspects such as methodology, research hypothesis and questions,
and more.</p>
<p>We thank our mentors for their support in making this Bootcamp successful
and for their invaluable contributions to the mentee’s grant application
journey!</p>
<p><strong>Looking to enhance your grant applications or research ideas? Keep a look out for subsequent runs of ACSI Bootcamp and IGRP, both happening twice yearly, designed in preparation for the NMRC Jan/Jul Grant Calls!</strong>
