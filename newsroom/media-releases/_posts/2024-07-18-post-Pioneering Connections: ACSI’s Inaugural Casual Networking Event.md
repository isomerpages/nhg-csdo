<p>On 27 June 2024, the LKCMedicine Clinical Sciences Building Level 20 Library
buzzed with vibrant discussions as approximately 50 members of the research
and innovation community gathered for an enriching networking event. Clinician
scientists and innovators, administrators, university faculty, and researchers
were brought together in this dynamic setting to exchange ideas, foster
collaborations, and explore innovations.</p>

<p>The event provided a unique platform for attendees to connect across disciplines,
bridging gaps between clinical practice and academic research. Without
designated speakers, the focus was on free-flowing exchange of ideas through
organic conversations and spontaneous discussions.</p>
<p>This will be the first of many interdisciplinary casual networking opportunities
by the ACSI to come, one of many memorable evenings for our research and
innovation community to bond over food and drinks.</p>
