<p>On 7 June 2024, ACSI held its first engagement event on research and innovation
mentorship, featuring Prof Best, ACSI Chief Mentor and former Dean of LKCMedicine.
With an extensive experience in research and education, Prof Best has authored
over 200 publications and guided numerous clinicians across his various
academic and clinical roles. The research and innovation huddle, attended
by Prof Leo Yee-Sin, ACSI Co-President, gathered other key research leaders
and national Clinician Scientists and Innovators, who are also established
mentors in research and innovation.</p>
<p>Prof Best opened the session by quoting the definition of mentorship from
The Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM (2019): “<em>Mentorship is a professional, working alliance in which individuals work together over time to support the personal and professional growth, development, and success of the relational partners through the provision of career and psychosocial support</em>”,
and his views on the difference between a mentor and a coach. The attendees
then had an in-depth discussion on the elements of an effective mentor-mentee
relationship, the distinct roles and responsibilities of mentors and mentees,
and the challenges of the mentoring process.</p>
<p>Organised by the ACSI Recruitment and Development Domain and facilitated
by Assoc Prof Angela Chow, ACSI Lead Mentor and Senior Consultant, TTSH,
the event was held at LKCMedicine Clinical Sciences Building.</p>
