<p>On the evening of 20 August, the NHG/LKCMedicine research and innovation
community gathered once again for the second run of our signature "ACSI
Evening" casual networking session. We brought together over 42 clinicians,
researchers, innovators, and staff, across NHG, LKCMedicine, and the wider
NTU, eager to connect and collaborate.</p>

<p>It was a relaxing <em>evening</em> where attendees mingled freely and engaged
in lively discussions over great food and drinks</p>

<p>As the ACSI Evening is set to become a regular twice-yearly fixture in
ACSIâ€™s calendar, it serves as an informal setting to foster a sense of
community and shared purpose, bringing our research and innovation community
closer.</p>
<p>So, keep an eye out for our next ACSI Evening and we hope to see you there!</p>
