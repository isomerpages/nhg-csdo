<p>On 13 July 2024, ACSI participated in the annual NHG Career Day to raise
awareness on the resources and opportunities that support research and
innovation within NHG! This was a valuable opportunity for ACSI to interact
with young clinicians ranging from medical students to senior residents.</p>
