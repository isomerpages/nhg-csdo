<p>Academic medicine is one key component of Singapore’s healthcare priorities.
The <strong>Academy of Clinician Scientists and Innovators (ACSI)</strong> was
established with the vision of providing a home for clinician scientists
and innovators at the <strong>National Healthcare Group (NHG) </strong>and
the <strong>NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine</strong>.</p>
<p>The ACSI’s mission is to improve medicine through early identification
of talents, postgraduate education and training, and support with translational
research programs.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the academy has been committed to promoting excellence
in clinical research and fostering the development of clinician scientists
and innovators. They are important players in translational medicine to
bridge research and clinical practice.</p>
<p>ACSI also provides a platform for researchers to work with the best minds
in academic medicine, and to exchange ideas on how to do translational
research to patient care.</p>
<p>Training and development programmes are available to provide our clinicians
with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in their field. By supporting
their development, ACSI is playing a key role in ensuring that Singapore
remains at the forefront of medical research.</p>
