<p>This workshop aims to equip Principal Investigators and research teams
with the knowledge to perform statistical analysis. Participants can expect
to gain an appreciation and understanding of bio-statistical ideas, particularly
in the context of clinical trials and other aspects of clinical research.
<br>
<br>Topics covered include summary statistics and hypothesis tests, with a
heavy emphasis on learning how to carry out statistical analysis independently
using SPSS.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The workshop will include a combination of lectures and SPSS hands-on
statistical tutorials. Participants can expect to be led through a series
of guided exercises and to learn how to carry out and apply independent
statistical analysis on their own.
