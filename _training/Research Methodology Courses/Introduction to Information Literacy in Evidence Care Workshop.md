<h4><strong>Synopsis</strong></h4>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, researchers and clinicians
grapple with unique questions pertinent to patient care, demanding the
acquisition of expert skills for effective evidence search and evaluation.
The contemporary healthcare arena necessitates advanced capabilities in
information retrieval and assessment, making it imperative for both researchers
and clinicians to cultivate proficiency in these areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This introductory workshop offers both clinicians and researchers a holistic
approach, delving into expert search skills while incorporating advanced
techniques in data collection, extraction, and screening to fortify the
research methodology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proficient literature review not only enhances evidence-based care but
also directly impacts positive patient outcomes. To further enrich the
learning experience, an innovative smartphone delivered AI tool in the
form of a chatbot is introduced; the <strong>Rileybot</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Developed collaboratively by the medical library and faculty from LKCMedicine, <strong>Rileybot</strong> serves
as an unparalleled resource, complementing the workshop's objectives and
providing invaluable assistance to learners on their information literacy
journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By equipping both researchers and clinicians with essential skills in
information literacy and evidence-based medicine, the workshop addresses
the evolving needs of healthcare practices in today's dynamic environment.</p>
