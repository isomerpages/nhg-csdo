<h4><strong>Synopsis</strong></h4>
<p>A critical aspect of the scientific process is the reporting of new results
in scientific journals in order to disseminate that information to the
larger community of researchers.</p>
<p>How can you order and organise the information you wish to present? How
can you enhance the chance of your paper being published? Which journal
should you submit your research paper?</p>
<p>This seminar will take you through the stages of developing a research
paper and discuss the common issues researchers face when writing a research
paper.&nbsp;</p>
