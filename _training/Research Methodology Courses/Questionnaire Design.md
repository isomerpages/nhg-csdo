<p>Questionnaires are an essential tool employed in quantitative research.
In order to get the most accurate and relevant data required, the design
of the questionnaire has to be done well, tailored to the needs of the
clinical research. This workshop provides an overview of questionnaire
design tailored for clinical research studies. Participants will learn
how to come up with the appropriate layout and questions for their questionnaires
that will allow them to get the desired variables. With an increasing emphasis
on population health studies, it is pertinent for research teams to design
effective questionnaires that will reflect accurate responses and results
of the respondents.
